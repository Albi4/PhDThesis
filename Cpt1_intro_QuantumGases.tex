	It is only in very recent times that it has begun to dawn upon\\ the mind of man that there is another world only one degree\\ less complex and wonderful than the stellar universe \\

Knuth}\citetalias{knuth:1974} \citep{knuth:1974} %For the study of these almost infinitesimal systems of pigmy stars we have no telescope nor even microscope to help us but little by little we are constructing a powerful logical engine which is destined one day to bring the revolutions rotations and oscillations of these minute orbs as clearly to the mind's eye as are now the motions of the worlds of the greater visible universe

\section{Why cold atoms?}%colder than the empty universe
%Introduction on the cold atoms field, historically from the MOT to the BEC to the superfluid BEC-BCS crossover. From the first dipolar \ac{BEC} to supersolids to the \ac{mBEC}.


Right at the turn of the 20th century 

why it is so interesting and relevant, great tunabilty, great test field  

Atoms are the most fundamental components that we can control with great precision 

\section{Quantum mixtures}%two is better than one

increase of the possibility to study  

BEC-BCS crossover here


\section{From fermionic spin mixtures to hetero-nuclear mixtures}%



Describe why mass imbalance and some description of the result obtained with other mixtures and describe why Dy-K is our choice 


Zaccanti's varenna notes have a lot of good reference on this

\section{Our choice: Dy-K }
